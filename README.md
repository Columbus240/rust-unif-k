# Unifiers in K

This is the code that generated the list in the post “[Unifiers in the Modal Logic K](https://groupoid.ch/math/2022/06/12/Unifiers_Modal_Logic.html)”.
I often varied the contents of the `main()` function.
So if you try to use it for anything, play around with it and/or contact me for help.

As long as nobody else is using it, I don't see much value in adding loads of
documentation.
