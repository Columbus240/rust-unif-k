# Unifiers in K

I developed this library over the course of my master's thesis.
It deals with validity and unifiability in the modal logic K.
As long as nobody else is using it, I don't see much value in adding loads of
documentation.
But if you try to use it for anything, play around with it and/or contact me
for help.

For examples on what it can do, check out the binaries in `src/bin`.
